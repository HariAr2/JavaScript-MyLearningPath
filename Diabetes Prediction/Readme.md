# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview: 
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques.

## Data:
The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' health attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. 

## Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Scaling numerical features
   - Encoding categorical variables   
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing distributions of features
   - Correlation analysis
   
3. **Model Building**:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Trying different classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
   - Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   
4. **Model Deployment**:
   
   - Choosing the best-performing model
   - Building an interface for prediction
   
## Files:

- `diabetes.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing

## Installation:

To run this project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```


## Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`diabetes.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis and model building.
4. Use the trained model for predictions or further improvements.
